# Reference Images Directory

## Required Reference PNGs for Overlay Validation

Place your reference screenshots here with these exact filenames:

### our-story.png
Full-page screenshot of the Our Story page at 1440px viewport width

### portfolio.png
Full-page screenshot of the Portfolio page at 1440px viewport width

### strategy.png
Full-page screenshot of the Strategy page at 1440px viewport width

---

## How to Use

Once these files are in place:
1. Open any page in your browser at 1440px width
2. Press **O** key to toggle overlay mode
3. The reference PNG will overlay at 50% opacity
4. Visually verify pixel-perfect alignment
5. Press **O** again to toggle off

This allows you to validate that the implementation matches your reference design exactly.
